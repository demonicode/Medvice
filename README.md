# Medvice

Medvice caters to individuals in search of comprehensive health information and management tools conveniently consolidated in one platform. It specifically targets those frustrated with the inaccuracies of self-diagnosing through internet searches, individuals requiring a unified platform to interact with their FHIR data, and healthcare professionals like doctors and nurses who need a streamlined view of patient history for effective diagnostic and treatment planning.

At the core of Medvice lies the Medvisor, an intelligent chatbot powered by fine-tuned language model algorithms. It specializes in interpreting medical queries and has the unique ability to analyze a user's FHIR data alongside their current symptoms. Medvisor provides preliminary diagnoses and actionable advice, whether it's recommending a doctor's visit or offering tailored diet and nutrition plans. Acting as a first line of consultation, Medvisor ensures users make informed health decisions.

In addition, Medvice features a Skin Cancer Detection tool, which utilizes cutting-edge vision transformer technology. This tool analyzes images of skin lesions to assess the likelihood of skin cancer, providing a quick and non-invasive preliminary screening method.

Furthermore, Medvice transforms the traditional way of viewing FHIR data by aggregating and visualizing medical records from various providers. Its intuitive interface presents health information in easily understandable charts, enhancing patient understanding and engagement with their own health data.
